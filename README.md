# local view

If you have been downloading this content (via zenodo for instance),  you can build the website locally using `blogdown::serve_site()` (you need to install R on your machine).

*In future version we will provide a version of the website one can see without doing nothing, but we still wonder how to best do that (a version in the public folder is built using `blogdown::hugo_cmd("--config config.yaml,Localbuild_config.yaml")` is one option.)*
