      <description>20022-05-13 &amp;ldquo;PI meeting&amp;rdquo; We had our first progress report with the lab heads Profs. Larkum, Jochem, and Lindgraf. We used a two hours window to present the new team members, as well as our progresses, successes and failures. We are now sharing these with all of you. We hope you will enjoy this summary of our presentations and discussions.
Introductions We started by using some extract of the interviews to illustrate the main issues we tackle, that is the discrepancy between :</description>

      <description>This blog post will present our progresses in our work on defining FAIR for research hardware. It has been updated, you can see its history on github.
Summary After a gosh forum entry and initial meetings, we have created a RDA group for FAIR hardware: httpS://rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-principles-research-hardware. The group has agreed on a charter that has been endorsed by the RDA. Our next tasks are:
 Preparing the plenary and get more members Work on the definition of open hardware.</description>

      <description>update 2022-05-02 The three positions have been filled, thanks to all who applied !
 In Open.Make we are looking for three motivated student assistants to support our research team and enrich it with your own unique and complementary skillset.
Any student of a Berlin university can apply to any of the three positions (salary 12,68 € brutto according to TV Stud III). The majority of the work needs to be done on site.</description>

      <description>On October 7th 2021, the Open.Make project kickoff meeting took place at the Charité campus in Mitte. The three research partners/labs, the project officer from the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) and three invited external partners presented and discussed their respective works. It was a successful meeting as it offered a broad overview of the benefits of open hardware in academia and beyond. While it was originally planned as fully in-person, the meeting had to be shifted to a hybrid meeting, as two participants could not come to the meeting location.</description>

      <description>The problem(s) Have you ever tried to follow instructions on how to assemble something and get stuck, either due to a lack of clarity or missing information? This can be annoying enough when you are trying to setup a new piece of furniture, but when your goal is to replicate someone&amp;rsquo;s research1, these annoyances create an additional burden. In the worst case, the research cannot be replicated and the research process is significantly slowed down.</description>

      <description>On September 1st the Berlin university alliance project Open.make: toward open and FAIR hardware has officially started. Three labs that work together for the first time will collaborate and design a social and technical infrastructure, in order to foster open and FAIR hardware publication and recognition. In this post, we will describe how the idea was developed over a short period of time following the publication of a BUA call.</description>
