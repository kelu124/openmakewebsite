      <description>On October 7th 2021, the Open.Make project kickoff meeting took place at the Charit√© campus in Mitte. The three research partners/labs, the project officer from the Berlin University Alliance (BUA) and three invited external partners presented and discussed their respective works. It was a successful meeting as it offered a broad overview of the benefits of open hardware in academia and beyond. While it was originally planned as fully in-person, the meeting had to be shifted to a hybrid meeting, as two participants could not come to the meeting location.</description>

      <description>The problem(s) Have you ever tried to follow instructions on how to assemble something and get stuck, either due to a lack of clarity or missing information? This can be annoying enough when you are trying to setup a new piece of furniture, but when your goal is to replicate someone&amp;rsquo;s research1, these annoyances create an additional burden. In the worst case, the research cannot be replicated and the research process is significantly slowed down.</description>
