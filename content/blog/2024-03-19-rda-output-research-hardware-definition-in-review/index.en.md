Dear reader,

Inside the open make project, we started to leverage the RDA network by helping build a community around the task of defining FAIR principle for research hardware. See [our previous post in 2021](/blog/2021/11/10/2021-11-12-fair4rh/).


It is a pleasure to inform you that the [Research data alliance interest group about FAIR for Research Hardware](https://www.rd-alliance.org/groups/fair-principles-research-hardware) has published his first output.
You can read the Definition of the Research hardware at  https://doi.org/10.15497/RDA00105



Public review has started and will go for about 30 days, be welcome to give us feedback !
