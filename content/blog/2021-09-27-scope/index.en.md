Have you ever tried to follow instructions on how to assemble something and get stuck, either due to a lack of clarity or missing information? This can be annoying enough when you are trying to setup a new piece of furniture, but when your goal is to replicate someone's research[^1] these increases in cost can create an artificial burden on entry.  In an ideal situation, whatever research you are trying to replicate would provide you with high quality, open documentation on how to construct any (hardware) components not readily available for purchase. What constitutes quality in hardware documentation, though, is not open to investigation, which can make it difficult to review hardware designs.

A different perspective on the issue, however, is that when you are the one initially designing the (hardware) components for an experiment, you are likely yourself under time constraints, which may limit the quantity and quality of any documentation you might otherwise be able to make. In an ideal situation, not only would you have the time needed for producing such documentation, but you would also be able to follow some guidelines on how to ensure its quality.

With open access publishing, open data, and free/libre open source software becoming important pillars of responsible research and innovation (RRI) there is also a growing school of thought aiming to establish and open hardware (OH) strategy for academia, in order to address the issues described above. In this project we intend to contribute to this by investigating the current practices concerning hardware documentation in order to figure out what technical requirements should be placed on it for the sake of quality. Following that we want to prototype an evaluation system for open hardware and test it against current use cases. The last thing we want to accomplish is maximize the impact of the results from the previous two goals by reaching out to the (international) community and participate in relevant workshops and conferences, as well as standartization efforts.
