# OpenMake II

It is a pleasure to announce that the open make project has been funded for another 2.5 years. The work will become more practical and local.
During the next three years, we will implement a technical tool which will allow for the publication of open research hardware, and build a academic maker community inside the BUA.

We are one of three project that received a second round of funding by the BUA ( https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/en/commitments/research-quality/forschung/index.html?ts=1690359598). 

# Other good news

It is also time to congratulate Sacha Hodencq, team member as a visiting scientist, who got a permanent position in Grenoble.
