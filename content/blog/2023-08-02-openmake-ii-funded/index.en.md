# OpenMake II

It is a pleasure to announce that the open make project has been funded for another 2.5 years. The work will become more practical and local.
We are one of three project that received a second round of [funding by the BUA]( https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/en/commitments/research-quality/forschung/index.html?ts=1690359598). 
While you can download the full application on zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8220972, here is a very short summary of our plans.

During the next nearly three years, we will work, on one hand, on hardware publication.
We will implementation of a technical tool which will allow for the publication of open research hardware.
Our work inside the RDA will cover the social and research culture aspects of creating a place for hardware publication in academia.

On the other hand, we will work locally. 
We will build a academic maker community inside the Berlin University Alliance institutions, and offer specific training in  open source hardware development for the university students.

# Other good news

## Guidance book

We worked with the TU Delft open hardware team and other GOSH members in the open hardware part of the Turing way book.
The chapter on open hardware has been updated, as well as the chapter on open project documentation (there is one chapter for both hardware or software projects). 
We also wrote a new part about open hardware licensing.

## Team success

It is also time to congratulate Prof. (!) Sacha Hodencq, team member as a visiting scientist, who got a permanent position in Grenoble. 
Our second visitor, Dr. Julieta Arancio, will continue her work as employed by the NASA.

R. Mies will defend his PhD thesis early next year, his lab at the TU also got some European grant money to work on local production of open hardware.
