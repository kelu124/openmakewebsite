# OpenMake II

It is a pleasure to announce that the open make project has been funded for another 2.5 years. The work will become more practical and local.
We are one of three project that received a second round of [funding by the BUA]( https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/en/commitments/research-quality/forschung/index.html?ts=1690359598). 
While you can download the full application on zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8220972, here is a very short summary of our plans.

During the next nearly three years, we will work, on one hand, on hardware publication.
We will implementation of a technical tool which will allow for the publication of open research hardware.
Our work inside the RDA will cover the social and research culture aspects of creating a place for hardware publication in academia.

On the other hand, we will work locally. 
We will build a academic maker community inside the Berlin University Alliance institutions, and offer specific training in  open source hardware development for the university students.

## The team 

The open make core team does not change.

It is also time to congratulate Prof. (!!) Sacha Hodencq, team member as a visiting scientist, who got a permanent position in Grenoble (Maître de conférences). 

Our second visitor, Dr. Julieta Arancio, got a wonderful opportunity as an [open accelerator fellow by Open Research Funders group](https://www.orfg.org/news/2023/10/02/orfg-welcomes-julieta-arancio-as-open-accelerator-fellow). 

Robert Mies will defend his PhD thesis early next year, he was also involved in another successful  grant application (Local Accessible Urban Digital and Sustainable Factories -LAUDS-, 2024-2027, Horizon Europe).
