On September 1st  the [Berlin university alliance]() project `Open.make: toward open and FAIR hardware` has officially started. Three labs that never work together will collaborate and design a social and technical infrastructure, in order to foster open and FAIR hardware publication and recognition. In this post, we will describe how the idea was developped over such a short period of time.

## A two months process

Between January and February of this year, the open.make team was created, the project was developed and the application was written. In response to the a [BUA call for open science and quality insurance](https://www.berlin-university-alliance.de/news/events/2021/210112-call-obj3.html), both Robert Mies (TU) and Julien Colomb (HU) wanted to work on an open hardware project. The embryonic idea of the latter was well complementing the more mature project of the former. With the support of their respective PIs, Prof. Jochem and Prof. Larkum, they started combining their objectives and knowledge. The addition of a practical approach via Tim Landgraf and his postdoc Moritz Maxeiner (FU) expertise, gave a final touch to the project. 



## Technology used

The project approach was debated in video conferences and asynchronously on the online drafts. Emails were used to organise meetings and search for external partners.
These drafts were written using a markdown-based approach via [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/open-science-promoters/BUAgrant_OSH), which was synchronized with an hackmd.io document. The idea was to produced a well-formatted pdf file from that document using pandoc. Because the submission portal accepted only text (and not our nice pdf), we moved to googledoc for the last changes in the application text.

## Personal experiences

I started thinking about a fitting project, as I found the granting scheme interesting. I thought that open hardware would be a good fit for the call and started to look for collaborators, connecting with people I knew from the field. Finally, an internet search for `open hardware berlin` got me to the [open!next](www.opennext.eu) project homepage, and I contacted its coordinator Robert Mies, with an embryonic idea. He was also planning to prepare an application for that call, and its plan was not very far from mine: it sounded like a perfect match (and it was). The rest was only nice discussions and hard work.
